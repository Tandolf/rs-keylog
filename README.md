### This is written as research and should NOT be used in any malicious activities. I take no responsability in any usage of this software. 

Usage and theory behind this will be updated later.

TODOS:
- [ ] check if run with sudo
- [ ] ability to take in log file as argument
- [ ] locate event file, or give event file manually
- [x] error handle if outside of key range
- [ ] send log file to url?
- [x] error handle written bytes
- [ ] handle different language key layouts? SWE, GER etc.
